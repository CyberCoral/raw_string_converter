# raw_string_converter
This program converts either from normal text to "raw" text, or from "raw" text to "pythonic" (python-like tabs and new-lines) text.

# New update (19 Jun 2025)
The new features and changes are: 
- The program supports strings with unicode characters.
- There are no more dictionaries with escape characters, \nnow it is all managed by str methods such as .decode() and .encode().
- The project does not require external libraries to work.
